## Course Description

This repository contains the code and documentations for the project of INDE 577, Data Science and Machine Learning, at Rice University in Spring 2023. In the course, we learned machine learning algorithms by using python language. Course topics consist of supervised learning, unsupervised learning and reinforcement learning methods.

## Repository Content

### Datasets

The primary dataset I used in this project is the Shill Bidding dataset. 

About the dataset: Online auctions for trading goods and services provide a convenient environment for malicious money-makers to conduct different types of fraudulent activities such as Shill Bidding (SB). This type of fraud is difficult to detect due to its similarity to normal bidding behavior.

The set of SB data we use is obtained through eBay auctions of a large number of popular products, which contains various behavioral data of auctioneers, such as Bidder Tendency, Bidder Ratio, Last Bidding, etc. And, two response variables are provided, one is class, which marks whether the observation is normal behavior bidding. The other is Winning Ratio, which marks the rate that a shill bidder competes in auctions.

In the project, various machine learning techniques were used on the data, trying to find out the features that are significant for fraud bidding recognition, make accurate predictions for future bidding, to achieve the purpose of anti-fraud.

The dataset contains 6321 instances and 13 attributes. Detailed infomation of them can be found in this repository **3. Data**.
