# Linear Regression
This folder contains the implementation of Linear Regression Single Neuron Model.

## Description
In this notebook, I first introduce the dataset and choose response variable and exploratory variables so that can be used to perform linear regression. Then I applied the linear regression model on the Shill Bidding dataset and tune the hyper-paramter (learning rate).

## Reference
Most of the modeling code in Linear_Regression.ipynb file are based on Dr. Davila's Lecture Notes and our text book 'Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow'.
