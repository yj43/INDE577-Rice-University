# Logistic Regression
This folder contains the implementation of Logistic Regression Single Neuron Model.

## Description
In this notebook, I first chose target variable and explain variables so that can be used to perform logistic regression. Then I visualized the cost function over the epochs during training,which helps me verify that are neuron is indeed learning over time.Lastly, the classification error on the training data Seaborn Confusion Matrix on the test data were shown to see the performance of the model.
