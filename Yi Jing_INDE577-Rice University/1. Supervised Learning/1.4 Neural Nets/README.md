# Neural Network: Multilayer Perceptron
This folder contains the implementation of Neural Network: Multilayer Perceptron.

## Description
In this notebook, I first introduce the dataset and choose response variable and exploratory variables so that can be used to perform Multilayer Perceptron. Then I applied the Multilayer Perceptron on the Shill Bidding dataset and checked the loss.

## Reference
Most of the modeling code in Multilayer_Perceptron.ipynb file are based on Dr. Davila's Lecture Notes and our text book 'Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow'.
