# k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)
This folder contains the implementation of the k-Nearest Neighbors Model.

## Description
In this notebook, I implemented the k-Nearest Neighbors based on the Shill Bidding Dataset, including KNN classification and KNN regression. During the construction of these two models, I first conducted the base KNN classification model with a default k and check the error performance. Then I did some experiments with different ùëò and found the k with the least classification error or MSE.
