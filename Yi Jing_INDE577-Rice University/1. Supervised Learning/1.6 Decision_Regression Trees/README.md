# Decision Tree
This folder contains the implementation of Desicion Tree Model.

## Description
For Shill Bidding Dataset, I used variables Class and Winning Ratio as the response variable to conduct the Decision Tree Classifier model and Decision Tree Regression model, respectively. Both of the two models show great performance.Besides, I tried to do some experiment with different max_depth and found the max_depth highest accuracy.
