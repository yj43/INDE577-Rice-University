# Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
This folder contains the implementation of the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) Model.

## Description
In this notebook, I implemented the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) based on the Shill Bidding Dataset. First, I showed how to calculate the first two principal components in code, and visualized the two principal components. In addition, more explorations of the properties of the principal components were performed using the scree plot and the transformed data in the the coordinate system. Finally, I also tried to plot the three-dimensional graph of the three principal components.
